# Title: Introducing Venue to Your Classroom

Hello Mr/Ms/Mrs. John Doe,

My name is [enter name here] and I work with [x] other developers on a class attendance tracking system called Venue under
the supervision of Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS). Venue is both a mobile and web application that's aim is to 
guarrantee that a student is present in your class. Primarily, Venue's goal is to minimize the amount of time 
attendance takes to collect and ensure the legitimacy of the attendance.

## How it Works

### As a student

Venues mobile application will be downloaded onto their smart phones. When first opening the application, the student will
enter their SIS credentials which will import their current academic schedule. When a student has class, the professor of
the class will put an image on the board. At this point, the student will use the camera functionality of Venue phone application and take
an image on the board. At this point, the students will have a unique identifier to the phone that it was taken on and if 
duplicates were to be found, a notification would be set off.

### As a professor

Venues desktop version will be used in this case. From the professors side, there will be a randombly generated QR code on the 
board that they can put up at any point in the class. The students take images and attendance records of each student updates
accordingly. There will also be a way for the images to be checked and screened by a TA. In this case, the TA can verify success
of the images if there is any sort of doubt in their legitimacy. At any point, attendance and student lookup can be done to view
each students record up until that point.

### Closing Remarks

We all understand that attendance is often a slow process within the classroom, taking away from the quality time that can be
used to aid students in an understanding of the material. SPecifically for larger courses, taking attendance is near impossible
unless a very insecure and easily hackable method is used (Google Forms, online quizzes). Venue would make attendance for these
classes a more streamlined and effective experience.

Best,
